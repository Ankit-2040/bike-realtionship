Case Study Of Bike Relationship Dataset:-

I'm using SQL JOINs to combine nine CSV files—orders, customers, products, etc.—into a single dataset for this data analytics project. Using subqueries for competitive pricing and customer segmentation, I'm examining sales performance by category, brand, store, and employee. In order to maximize operational, marketing, and inventory efficiency, I'm gathering insights.
